## Commands

### Installation

This project was created using ruby 2.7.2 (see .ruby-version).

I use rbenv to install different ruby versions, you may need to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh).

```bash

$ brew install ruby-build rbenv

$ rbenv install

$ gem install bundler

$ bundle install
```

### Testing with rspec

```
$ rspec
```

### Linting with RuboCop

```
$ bundle exec rubocop
```

If you want to correct all cops

```
$ bundle exec rubocop -A
```

### Test coverage

After running the rspec command, a new directory is created to show test coverage

```
$ open coverage/index.html
```
